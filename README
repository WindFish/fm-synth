This is a phase modulating synthesizer using jack

Dependencies:
- Jack Audio Connection Kit
- Probably stuff I forgot.

Try starting the synth and type "help".
And ignore the debugging output.

Format for the .prog files:

	oscillators=<number of oscillators>

	<PARAM>=<value>
	<PARAM>=<value>
	...

	controllers:
	<PARAM>=<affect value>
	...

	defaults:
	cont[<CTRL NUMBER>]=<default value>
	...

	velocity:
	<PARAM*>=<velocity expression>
	...

where <PARAM> is one of:
mod[x][y]:	controls how oscillator #x modulates oscillator #y.
out[x]:		output level of oscillator #x.
waveform[x]:	waveform number of oscillator #x, or "440:filename.wav", where 440 denotes
		the frequency of the sound in the file.
sync[x]:	0 or 1, whether this oscillator #x should be reset on every sync point or not
factor[x]:	frequency factor of this osc
trem[x]:	tremolo depth
trem_lfo[x]:	which LFO oscillator to use for tremolo
vib[x]:
vib_lfo[x]:	same for vibrato
attack[x]
decay[x]
sustain[x]
release[x]:	time (in seconds) for the A/D/S/R phases of the envelope
hold[x]:	0 or 1. if set, the release phase is only entered upon NOTE OFF. if unset, release
		is entered immediately after the sustain phsae.
ksl[x]/ksr[x]:	key scale level/rate: affect amplitude or ADSR-phase-length depending on pitch

filter.		this filter is applied to the final mix of all oscillators.
	enabled:	enable the high frequency cutoff filter.
	env_amount:	how much the filter gets affected by the filter envelope
	attack
	decay
	sustain
	release
	hold
	offset:		cutoff frequency factor of the filter if unaffected by envelope
	resonance:	filter resonance, 0 .. 1
	trem
	trem_lfo

sync_factor:	frequency of the "oscillator reset" signa;
freq.	
	env_amount
	attack
	decay
	sustain
	release
	hold

<PARAM*> may only be "mod", "out", "filter env res off", "freq env".

<value> may be a simple expression containing numerical calculations:
Examples: 1/2, 4, 5.4*9/2


<affect value> is:
	ctrl[<MIDI CTRL NUMBER>]*<value> + ctrl[<OTHER MIDI CTRL NUMBER>]*<value> + ...

<velocity expression> is:
	vel*<value> + <value>, where "vel" is a reserved keyword

the "controllers:", "defaults:" and "velocity:" sections are optional.


lfo number can also be "snh", for sample and hold of random data.

about the note compiler: this generates sourcecode for a certain .prog file and
generates a .so shared object which then can be loaded. It's supposed to improve
the performance.
